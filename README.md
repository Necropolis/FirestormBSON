A Binary JSON parser for Objective-C.

# FirestormBSON

I kind of lied; it isn't a proper parser, rather a wrapper on top of the MongoDB BSON driver. It's built to behave quite a lot like NextiveJSON.

As of this writing, it's still very new and there are a ton of bugs and performance improvements possible. Forks/pull requests, trouble tickets, and general suggestions are welcome!
